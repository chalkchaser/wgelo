Frequently asked Questions
What is elo?  
The Elo system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players. It is used in a variety of leagues in games such as Chess or Tabletennis. The difference of player ratings is taken into consideration when a match is recorded. A weaker player gains more points by beating a higher rated player than a lower rated one. For more information, you can visit Wikipedia  
What does my rating of x mean?  
The higher the score, the better. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64% if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%.
Which formula do you use to calculate the elo?  
The standard formula is being used, with a starting elo of 1200 and a permanent k-value of 16.
