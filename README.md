## About Wgelo

WGElo allows you to create players and record their matches. It provides a database, to track and store every player's elo rating, as well as their profile to view individual rating progressions. This app was created for my casual but fiercely competitive friend group. There is a variety of use cases for elo tables, such as tracking fantasy leagues and predicting game outcomes. Our friend group uses this app to track matches and player skill in our semi-casual chess tournaments and other skill-related games.
